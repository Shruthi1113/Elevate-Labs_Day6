This analysis looks at how Walmart stores performed over time and what factors influenced their sales. We tracked monthly revenue and the number of stores contributing to it, both for 2010â€“2012 and across all years, to see overall trends. We also explored which stores did the best, how holidays affected sales, and how things like temperature influenced customer buying. By looking at yearly patterns, holiday weeks, and seasonal changes, we get a clear picture of what drives sales and which stores shine during peak periods.
